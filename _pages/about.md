Welcome! 

My website aims to highlight a few of my current and previous work/hobby
endeavors. 

A little about my academic efforts:

I obtained a BA in physics with a minor in mathematics at the University of 
North Carolina at Charlotte. I continued my studies at UNCC by completing 
a MSc in applied physics with a focus in computational physics. I am currently 
pursuing a PhD in physics with a concentration on quantum information and 
quantum computing, focusing on silicon based spin qubits.

Aside from my academics, I have many other interests, of which I have highlighted 
a few.
