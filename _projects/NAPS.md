The Non-parametric Adaptive Partitioning and Stitching (NAPS) algorithm is a
method which estimates the Probability Density Function (PDF) of univariant 
data (x) for applications to large data sets. The primary goal was to create an 
approach that requires no a prior knowledge of the underlying PDF and to create 
an efficient algorithm suited for High Performance Computing (HPC) applications.

    The algorithm starts by calculating a ration of sparse/dense differences (Î”x) in a sample from the data set based
    on a data driven windowing function (w).
</div>

The ratio determines whether a partition should be made in the original sample. This sub-routine 
is applied to the original sample and any subsequent partitioned data sub-samples.

An example of the PDF estimated using the NAPS algorithm is shown for a tri-modal
normal PDF.

A strength of the NAPS algorithm is the ability to accurately estimate more "exotic" PDFs.
