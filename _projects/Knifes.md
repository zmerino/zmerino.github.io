I was fortunate to move in with someone interested in the art/science of making
knifes and metallurgy. The following are a few outcomes from my time having been
allowed access to their workshop. I have outlined a few of the steps necessary in 
making knifes for culinary purposes.

# Forge and Blade Profiling

If desired, a knife can start from un-formed piece of various material forged into 
a rough form prior to profiling.

# Kife Geometry 

I played around with a few different knife designs. One of the first was a 
full tang design (knife material runs the full length of the handle) and the others were 
a partial tang design (knife material extends partially into handel).

## Full tang

        width="75%"%}

# Cryogenic Tempering

For some knives made of stainless steel, a cryogenic tempering process was applied 
in the attempts to increase the hardness of the blades. A Dewar of liquid nitrogen was 
acquired for such tests.
