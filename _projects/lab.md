Probing devices at room temperature to test isolation or continuity. If devices exhibit desired 
electrical characteristics, they will be: mounted to PCB boards, wirebonded, tested at room temperature 
in a cryostat probe, and cooled for testing at cryogenic temperatures.

Wirebond working devices are ready to cool down in liquid and dry cryostats to ~1.6K or tens of milli-Kelvin.

From time to time, the liquid cryostat can accumulate frozen water/nitrogen/oxygen in undesired locations 
that impact the operation of the cryostat. This can require the cryostat to be warmed to room temperature 
to evaporate unwanted elements. This process is typically done in a manner that collects/recycles the 
precious Helium.
